Reflection on Project Management Tools :
                                        These tools allow the team to break down complex projects into manageable tasks, assign responsibilities, and track progress.
Significance of Milestones:This milestone serves as the main objective for the project, helping the team stay aligned and track progress toward outcome.
Issues:It allows detailed tracking of bugs, features, and tasks, ensuring accountability.
Project Boards:Move issues from "To Do" to "In Progress" as team members start working on them.
               Move issues to "Done" upon completion.
               This visual workflow helps the team monitor the project's status and manage workload effectively.
Selected Issues:
               "Fix the even number program issue": This is crucial for ensuring the code gives correct ouput or not.
               "Write a README.md file": Improves user experience and easy to understand to developers in future.
